# Henon-Map
[Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9non_map)
>The **Hénon map** is a discrete-time dynamical system. It is one of the most studied examples of dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. The Hénon map takes a point (xn, yn) in the plane and maps it to a new point.

Most areas of the map are boring. So there is a map of "coolness" in the background which highlighting some interesting areas. This map was drawn by specific empiric "coolness formula". It can help you to explore the original Henon Map plot.
